-- Horrible lua crypto library intended for non-serious use in computercraft programs
-- Created as an educational exercise, not as serious cryptographic software
-- My only qualifications are a high school degree with a couple AP classes (that were not about 
-- crypto or math), don't trust this.

local crypto = {}
