# Bricks

This is a ComputerCraft package manager that contains all of my projects I've
written after 2019. There will probably be more soon. 

To install: run the contents of execute_oneliner.lua in a lua console. 

From that point you can run `bricks install` to install programs, `bricks
update` to update package listings, `bricks search` to search, and `bricks
remove` to uninstall.

Here's some of the projects I wrote that can be installed through this package
manager:

## rncat

Debugging utility for rednet stuff. Useful probably.

## TacoNet

Taco (Pam's HarvestCraft) delivery system. Orders would be placed using the
`orderfood` command, and they would be received on the computer running
`orderterminal`. The deliveryman could use the `tn` tool to confirm the order
and show the progress of the order, as well as mark it as delivered when it was
finally finished.
