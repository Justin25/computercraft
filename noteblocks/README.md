# Noteblocks 

This is an old project (2018) of mine to create a noteblock piano that could
read in song files (in the end I only wrote out the start of
[one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjvL-BgNv_Q)) and then play them on a
series of noteblocks. It had support for multiple simultaneous voices. If you
ever choose to use this thing, change the constants that the note values
correspond to in voicesync.lua.
